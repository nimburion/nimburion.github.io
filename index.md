  <h1>Nimburion is the Go ecosystem for building and orchestrating cloud-native microservices with production-grade solidity and operational control.</h1>
  <p>
    From service composition to lifecycle management, it brings order to complexity without sacrificing speed.

<section class="section about">
  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>
    Nimburion was created to turn distributed-system growth into a governable process. It combines components and conventions
    to design cloud-native microservices with production robustness, measurable reliability, and sustainable scalability.
    Its approach is organic but controlled: it leaves room for product evolution while preserving architectural coherence,
    operational standards, and clear domain boundaries. The result is a faster path from prototype to production,
    with less friction and greater confidence.

  <h2>Why Nimburion</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Prod-ready by design:</strong> patterns, modules, and guardrails that reduce variability and technical debt.</li>
    <li><strong>Orchestration and lifecycle:</strong> tools and integrations to manage rollouts, dependencies, and environments.</li>
    <li><strong>Reliability first:</strong> observability, resilience, and operational practices built in.</li>
    <li><strong>Scalability without chaos:</strong> grows with teams and workloads while keeping clarity and control.</li>
    <li><strong>Go-native:</strong> performance, simplicity, and modern tooling without compromise.</li>
  </ul>
